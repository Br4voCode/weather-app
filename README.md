- üìÖ See daily forecasts including max/min temperatures and weather codes
- üîç Search for weather by geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- ‚ö° Fast, responsive UI built with React 19 and TailwindCSS
- üñºÔ∏è Modern card-based UI with optimized images and fonts
- üõ°Ô∏è Graceful fallback to mock data if the weather API fails
